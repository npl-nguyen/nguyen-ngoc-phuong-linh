Abstract: Despite being within the top 5 biggest world exporters of rice, Viet Nam’s farming
sector has been experiencing low productivity. A typical Vietnamese farm household owns
multiple rice plots of very small sizes, which leads to high logistics costs and hinders large-
scale production. In order to improve productivity, local governments have been
implementing a land consolidation program by merging small plots together. However, this
program has met several oppositions, mostly due to the widely-acclaimed inverse
relationship between land size and productivity. To investigate this relationship, this study
collected a sample of 1204 rice plots from 464 households in Ha Tinh, Viet Nam. Its results show
that while the relationship between farm size and output (harvest) is mixed, farm size does
exhibit increasing return to scale on profit, which supports the rationale behind the program.
Nonetheless, when analyzing regions that have gone through consolidation, the program’s
results are unclear. Several regional, cultural, and historical factors affecting the program’s
outcomes are discussed.
